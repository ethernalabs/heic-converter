## heic-converter

Built with rust, to build you need [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) and [libheif](https://github.com/ImageMagick/heif) and [imagemagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick) installed.

This binary converts HEIC to png format with high quality and compressed it on jpg format. Both PNG and JPG images will be saved at `output` folder. 
The said folder will be generated by the binary if it didn't exist.

## Why not just use imagemagick and script on converting the images

Yes you can do that, but again I also added image compression for my own use.
