## heic-converter

Built with rust, to build you need [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) and [libheif](https://github.com/ImageMagick/heif) and [imagemagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick) installed.

This binary converts HEIC to png format with high quality and compressed it on jpg format. Both PNG and JPG images will be saved at `output` folder. 
The said folder will be generated by the binary if it didn't exist.

At the moment, it is only built with Windows Executable.

## How To

```
.\heic-converter.exe <file-path>

# Converts image.heic file
# .\heic-converter.exe ".\data\image.heic"

# Converts the content of data directory
# .\heic-converter.exe ".\data"
```

## Why not just use imagemagick and script on converting the images

Yes you can do that, but again I also added image compression for my own use.
